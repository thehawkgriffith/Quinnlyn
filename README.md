# Quinnlyn
Quinnlyn is a Seq2Seq model of Deep Natural Language Processing, with a bidirectional stacked LSTM Recurrent Neural Network mapping. This model is currently untrained because of some low-end technical issues of my current work machine. Hence only in prototype stage currently. Further improvements in line.
