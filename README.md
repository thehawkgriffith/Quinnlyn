# Quinnlyn
Quinnlyn is a Seq2Seq model of Deep Natural Language Processing, with a bidirectional stacked LSTM Recurrent Neural Network mapping. This model is currently untrained because of some low-end technical issues of my current work machine. Hence only in prototype stage currently. Further improvements in line.
Used modules are TensorFlow v1.0.0, unadaptable to newer versions due to the prepare_attention method and other reasons of implementation.
Built in Python 3.5.
Training data set of corpus movie conversations.
